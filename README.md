# GA Capstone Project: Boston Bike Hire

This repository contains the documentation and code for my Capstone project on a Blue Bike share, a government owned bike share system, undertaken as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course between September 2021 and December 2021.

**Part 1: Pitch and Problem Statement** - Define problem statement, potential audience, goals, success metrics and data sources of two potential ideas for the Capstone. Present the two proposal in a short presentation, describing the methods used. written proposal is also uploaded, including the chosen dataset (Bluebike)

**Part 2: Dataset and Data Collection** - Source the required data for the project, perform preliminary cleaning of the data. document the progress in a short blog from Jupyter Notebook

**Part 3: EDA and Data Visualisation** - Describe your data in depth using the EDA method, cleaning and rearranging the data, while maintaining the perspective on our goal and scope respectively. 


**Part 4: Modelling** - Detail your model and approach with concisely commented code, beginning with executive summary. Evaluate model performance and discuss results. Submit a complete notebook of the model. This include regression models and Gridsearch 

**Part 5: Presentation** - Host a short, well rehearsed presentation of your project for a non-technical audience. Cover goals, success criteria, data, approach, basic description of model, findings, risks/limitations, impact, next steps and conclusions.


# Boston Bike Share

Massachusetts, is one of the most bike-friendly states in the country, with Boston and Cambridge considered the best places for cyclists. With a population of 4.87 million, Boston is ranked No. 6 most bikeable city in the US. Since the late 19th century, cycling has been a popular activity in Boston, for both recreation and commuting around campuses of the numerous universities in the city. The state worked hard by investing in updated infrastructure, building roads with bicycle tracts, and founding one of the nationâ€™s first public bike-sharing systems, Bluebike. 
  
BlueBikes is a government-owned bike-share company, all across Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Newton, Revere, Salem, Somerville, or Watertown. A user can pick up a bike at any station dock, ride it for a specific amount of time, and then return it to any station for re-docking.

# Hypothesis and Aim 

**How well can we predict a user's Trip Duration?**

The aim was to build a model that would classify whether it is possible to predict the trip duration of a user within the dataset. 


# Goal

To accurately point out what affects the duration of people using the Bluebike Bike share, i.e. the distance itself, the month of usage, day, time of day, gender, or even birth year.

The project also aims to establish a relationship between the duration and mileage of the bike.

The mileage is predicted using the Geopy method, where the latitude and longitude of its starting and ending position is calculated.
In order to fulfil the goal, this project contains both models done by linear and logistic classification. The classification model of choice is the standard logistic regression, KNN neighbour, and gridsearch, in order to identify the coefficient model, for predicting the features.


# Data

The data is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/bluebikes-in-boston, which contains two dataset: "bluebikes_tripdata_2019.csv" "bluebikes_tripdata_2020.csv"
There are 2,522,771 rows and 17 columns for the first dataset (2019), and 1,999,446 rows & 18 columns for the second one (2020).
With the two dataset, it enables us to compare the difference in the trip duration of both years.
